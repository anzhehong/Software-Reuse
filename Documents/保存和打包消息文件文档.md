## Funcitions

###Write message into files 


1. **PM.Write**
	
	The method is made in static way,therefor we can use it without instantiation.
	
	```java
	/**
     * 1.``content`` will be written into ``fileName`` in ``outPath``.If there is *no such a file name``fileName`` in ``outPath``ï¼Œa new file named ``fileName`` *will be created in ``outPath`` and the ``content`` will be written into it.
     * 
    */
    
    
    public static void Write(String fileName, String content, String outPath);
	```

###Zip files daily


1. **PM.fileToZip**

 	The method is made in static way,therefor we can use it without instantiation.
	
	```java
		/**
		 *1.To find out whether a file has been zipped,we decided that if a file has *been zipped,we will rename it instanly *by adding a ``y`` at the begining of
		 *it name to notify that it has been zipped.
		 *2.All the files in ``sourceFilePath`` will be tranversed and those do not *have a beginning``y`` will be zipped to a zipfile named by the exact time *into the file``zipFilePath``.
		*/
	
	
		public static boolean fileToZip(String sourceFilePath,String zipFilePath,String fileName);
	```


###Zip files weekly	


1.  **PM.unZipFile**

	The method is made in static way,therefor we can use it without instantiation.
	
	```java
		/**
		 Provided the ``zipFilename`` and ``unzipPath`` ,the ``zipFilename`` will be unzipped into ``unzipPath``.
		*/
	
	
		public static void unZipFile(String zipFilename,String unzipPath);
	```
2.	**PM.WeeklyZip**

	The method is made in static way,therefor we can use it without instantiation.
	
	```java
		/**
		 Provided the ``sourceFilePath``,the files in the``sourceFilePath`` which has not been zipped will be zipped into a new file named ``fileName`` in the path ``zipFilePath``.
		*/
	
	
		public static boolean WeeklyZip(String sourceFilePath,String zipFilePath,String fileName);
	```


##Where and how to use above methods

###Client

- Once a client send message to the server,the message will be recorded into the  file by method ``PM.Write``. 
- Every file will be named by the day it is created with a prefix ``''client''``.

###Server

- Once a server receive a message from the client, the message will be recorded into the server file by method ``PM.Write``.
- Every file will be named by the day it is created with a prefix ``''Server''``.
- As soon as we enable the server,a timer will be enabled at the same time.And it will make sure that the ``Zip files daily`` function runs every 24 hours to create zip file.
- As soon as we enable the server,another timer will be enabled at the same time.And it will make sure that the ``Zip files Weekly`` function runs every 7 days to unzipped the zip files in the recent 7 days and then zipped them again into a new zip file.
- Every zip file will be named by the exact moment it is created.





## Features
