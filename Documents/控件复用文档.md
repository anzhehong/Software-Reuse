## Requirement

* Java JDK 1.6 +
* IntelliJ Idea 2014 +
* Maven 3 +


> Note: If your project is not based on Maven, the 3rd requirement can be omitted.


## Installing

### Maven

	<dependency>
            <groupId>tj.sse.reuse.group2</groupId>
            <artifactId>License</artifactId>
    </dependency>

### Jar
	

## Usage

-   you should Instantiate the object that you would like to use.  

	`FrequencyRestriction FrequencyRestriction = new FrequencyRestriction(num);`
> Note: The value of num confirm the limit of the component is "num" per second. 
	

- . Use the function "Check()" at the place which you want to limit.

	`FrequencyRestriction.Check()`
- . The function will return false or true to tell you whether the action is limited or not.
	 
- . For the class "MaxNumOfMessage()". it is same as what we talked before.

- . If you have **several** object that wanted to be limited.</br>
you can use **Multi-** just call the function `.addMap(name)` </br> 
And called `.CheckByKey(name)` to limit the certain object


## Features
###Example:
	FrequencyRestriction frequencyRestriction = new FrequencyRestriction(10)
	 for(int i = 0 ;i < 11;i++){
            System.out.print(i + " ");
            Thread.sleep(50);
            Boolean test = frequencyRestriction.Check();
            System.out.println(test);
        }
> We call the function `Check()` for 11 times in one seconds,so the 11th output of `test` is false, The previous output is true.
> 
	`0 true`
	`1 true`
	`2 true`
	`3 true`
	`4 true`
	`5 true`
	`6 true`
	`7 true`
	`8 true`
	`9 true`
	`10 false`
