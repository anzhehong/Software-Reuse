# Introduction

This is an C-S Java Application to send messages between clients. Of course the messages sent by logged-in clients are validated firstly by the server and then forwarded to all of the valid clients.

One more important thing: the application is named as `Naught`.

It may be a bad thing for learning the useful thing, `Socket`. Therefore we choose a name sounds like `Naughty` to make up. hhhhh...there seems to be nothing deserves laughing, right?...

# Directory

In the main Directory of our Git project, you will see two main directories: 

1. `Naughty` is the main project directory, including all of the source code and test code.
2. `Documents` is the directory for project documents, written in Chinese, for better explanating our thoughts without misunderstanding...
3. `Disscussion` is the direcotry for in-class discussion homework, which is finished independently.
